## Statement of intent

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

![](../sptr/images/8-cXvC8O7tWjWWp46.png)

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
In my research, I want to know if and how mental imagery, evoked from just listening to an audio stimulus, is useful in developing understanding of non-trivial or complex ideas.\
\
This seminar will describe the arts-based approaches I am going to use to stimulate, capture and validate that evocation.

Imagery is created in the mind of a listener from their own imagination, knowledge and experience in response to an audio stimulus.

# Activity

## Are you sitting comfortably?

Please put your pens and devices down for a moment and listen. 

It may help to close your eyes, although it isn't really necessary. 

Allow the sound to do its work in your head. 

It's ok if you need to doodle or jot down a note.

## Sketch

... a representation of what you were feeling during the music. 

### Prompts
* did it change over time?
* if so, how can you show that?
* were there people? colours? places? memories? 
* What was different about how you were feeling at the end?

## Talk and share

* Explain to a partner what your sketch represents. 
* Take turns
* Agree if one of you are happy to share to the rest of us.
* Sharing of one or two sketch stories with the group.

# Research design ideas

## Research design ideas

Constructing the "radio programme"

Capturing the response through sketching, then talking

Validation using a fictionalised account of their narrative

# Discussion / Questions

## Discussion / Questions

We have time now to discuss what I've offered in this seminar, relate it to sustainability ideas, including perhaps how this approach might be helpful in developing better empathy in new teachers.
