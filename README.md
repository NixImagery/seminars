# Seminars

This repository contains presentations and handouts for seminars and the like, that I have made and shared. 

There are two other github repositories that might be useful to you, which are small working examples for [mkdocs]((https://github.com/NixImagery/SWE-mkdocs)) and [bookdown]((https://github.com/NixImagery/SWE-bookdown)) websites. Download these to get a starting point for your own site.
